## How to use
### How to run
`python main.py`

### Shortcuts
#### Keyboard

1-9  : loads predefined maps (i.e. maze1.txt)

l    : loads previously saved map (maze.txt)

s    : saves the map (maze.txt)

r    : clears the map

f    : fills the map

a    : change algorithm, type the name of the algorithm into the terminal

enter: run the algorithm with current map

#### Mouse

left click: puts an obstacle

right click: puts/removes starting location, puts/removes ending location, removes obstacle

### Algorithms

This is the package that you should implement your algorithm. 

Your algoritm should have following properties:

- Is the the child of SearchAlgorithmBase from base.py
- File name and algorithm class name should be same
- Overload functions and implement other necessery functions for your algorithm
